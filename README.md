# **Tailblox**

> **Custom Theme Styles with Theme Functions!**  
Tailblox allows you to create and apply reusable, customizable GUI themes with ease. Define theme properties, add functions, and use them seamlessly in your Roblox games.

---

## **Getting Started**  

### **Step 1: Require the Tailblox Module**  
The first step is to require the `Tailblox` module in your game. It works anywhere within your project.  

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Tailblox = require(ReplicatedStorage.Tailblox)
```

---

### **Step 2: Create Your Custom Theme**  
Create a theme by passing a table to the `Tailblox` function. This table should define the theme's properties and optional functions for advanced customization.  

```lua
local myTheme = Tailblox({
    -- Theme Properties
    BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(16, 16, 16), -- Background color
    BorderColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(255, 255, 255), -- Border color
    BorderSizePixel = 1,                          -- Border thickness
    Size = UDim2.new(0.1, 0, 0.1, 0),             -- Size of the GUI element
    AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0.5, 0.5),          -- Anchor point for positioning
    Position = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0),         -- Position on the screen

    -- Theme Functions
    myFunction = function()
        print("Hello from DarkTheme!")
    end,

    myCoolPrintFunction = function(optionalArguments)
        print(table.unpack(optionalArguments)) -- Unpack arguments for output
    end,
})
```

### **Tip:**  
You can include as many properties and functions as needed in your theme, giving you full control over customization.

---

### **Step 3: Apply Your Theme**  
Use the `:apply()` function to apply your theme to any `GuiObject` (e.g., Frames, Buttons, TextLabels). This simplifies the styling process and ensures consistency across your gameâ€™s UI.  

```lua
local myFrame = Instance.new("Frame")
myTheme:apply(myFrame)
```

---

### **Step 4: Run Theme Functions**  
Run any function defined in your theme using the `:run()` method. Pass the function name as the first argument, and optionally, provide additional arguments as the second argument.

```lua
-- Run a simple function
myTheme:run("myFunction")

-- Run a function with arguments
myTheme:run("myCoolPrintFunction", {"Hello", "World!"})
```

**Important Note:**  
Make sure the function name provided as the first argument matches exactly with the function defined in your theme.

## **Features**  

- **Reusable Themes:** Save time by applying the same styles to multiple `GuiObjects`.
- **Custom Functions:** Add and execute functions specific to your theme, enhancing functionality.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Quickly adjust properties like size, position, and colors from a central theme.
